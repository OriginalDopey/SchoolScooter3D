# 🛴 School Scooter 3D

This is the next evolution of the School Scooter project, now built in Unity for true 3D gameplay and advanced features.

## � Recent Development (July 20, 2025)
- Obstacle spawning system: Obstacles spawn ahead of the player as you move forward, with adjustable frequency.
- Player model: Middle school boy built from Unity primitives (capsule, sphere, cylinders, backpack).
- Input: Uses Unity Input System (arrow keys, ready for touch).
- Debug logging: Added to spawner for troubleshooting.
- DevLogs: All development steps and instructions are recorded in `DevLogs/DevLog_2025-07-20.txt`.

## �👦 Project Origin
A collaboration between a dad and his 12-year-old son, designed to make programming approachable and fun, with real-time code insights and interactive gameplay.

## 🚀 Game Summary
- Genre: Endless runner
- Player: Middle school boy on a scooter 🛴 (custom model built in code)
- Setting: School hallway with blue/orange lockers
- Obstacles: Desks, chairs, student crowds
- Collectibles: Money for points
- Power-ups: (TBD)
- Failure: Collision ➝ teacher catches you ➝ yelling cutscene
- Progression: Tutorial, increasing speed
- Input: Keyboard + Touchscreen
- Platform: Unity (PC, Mac, Chromebook, iPad)

## 🧠 “Stuff for Geeks” Console
- Shows player stats, collisions
- Explains game mechanics in kid-friendly terms
- Allows tweaking values mid-run

## 📅 Dev Plan & Progress
- Phases 1–5 completed (endless runner, scoring, obstacles, cutscene, geek panel)
- Obstacle spawning and player visuals implemented (see DevLogs).
- Next: Touchscreen support, polish (SFX, animations, transitions)
- Stretch goals: Power-ups, shop, online leaderboard, PWA, editable code blocks

## 🔐 Known Limitations
- No character customization yet
- Scores saved locally
- No level builder/mod tools
- No advanced animation (simple running pose only)

## 🌱 Stretch Goals
- Power-ups: speed burst, ghost mode
- Score-based shop
- Online leaderboard
- Installable PWA
- Editable code blocks in-game

## 🗂 DevLogs
See `DevLogs/DevLog_2025-07-20.txt` for a detailed log and setup instructions.

## 🛴 Built with code, creativity, and scooter speed by a dad & son team.
