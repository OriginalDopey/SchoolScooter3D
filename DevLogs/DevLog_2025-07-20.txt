# Development Log - July 20, 2025

## Summary
- Set up obstacle spawning system that spawns obstacles ahead of the player as they move forward.
- Fixed input system errors by updating PlayerController to use Unity's Input System.
- Created a script to visually build a middle school boy character using Unity primitives (capsule, sphere, cylinders).
- Added debug logging to ObstacleSpawner for troubleshooting.
- Provided step-by-step instructions for Unity Inspector setup.

## Instructions to Recreate
1. **Obstacle Spawner**
   - Attach `ObstacleSpawner.cs` to an empty GameObject.
   - Assign obstacle prefabs (desk, chair, crowd) to the `obstaclePrefabs` array in the Inspector.
   - Assign the player GameObject to the `player` field.
   - Adjust `spawnInterval` for spawn frequency.

2. **Player Controller**
   - Attach `PlayerController.cs` to the player GameObject.
   - Ensure movement uses the Input System (arrow keys).

3. **Middle School Boy Model**
   - Attach `MiddleSchoolBoyBuilder.cs` to the player GameObject (Capsule).
   - The script will build the head, arms, legs, and backpack automatically.

4. **Debugging**
   - Check the Unity Console for debug messages from ObstacleSpawner.
   - If obstacles do not spawn, verify prefabs and player are assigned in the Inspector.

## Next Steps
- Add running animation to the player.
- Implement collectibles and scoring.
- Polish obstacle visuals and add more variety.
- Save and commit all changes to git.
