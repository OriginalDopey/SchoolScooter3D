# DevLog Entry - July 20, 2025 (Session 3)

## Goal
Refine the player character to look like a boy riding a scooter, kicking his leg for momentum, with a navy blue shirt and khaki pants. Target: production-ready, visually appealing model.

## Plan
- Replace the simple primitive-based character with a more detailed, stylized boy model.
- Add a scooter model (handlebars, deck, wheels) using Unity primitives.
- Animate the character: one leg on the scooter, the other kicking for momentum.
- Use navy blue for the shirt and khaki for the pants.
- Ensure proportions, colors, and pose are realistic and visually polished.
- Document all steps and code for reproducibility.

## Next Steps
1. Create a new script to build the refined character and scooter.
2. Add animation logic for the kicking leg.
3. Polish materials and proportions for a production-ready look.
4. Test in Unity and iterate for realism.
5. Log all changes and commit to git.
