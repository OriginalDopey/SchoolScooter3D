## Topic: iOS Release Planning

- Confirmed that the current Unity design pattern (primitives, scripts, Input System) is compatible with iOS and Apple App Store requirements.
- No major code changes are needed for iOS export; Unity supports building for iOS out of the box.
- Recommended workflow: Build and polish the game first, then add iOS-specific features (touch controls, icons, privacy, etc.) before release.
- It is perfectly fine to wait until the platform is feature-complete before making iOS-specific modifications.
- Next steps for iOS: Switch build target to iOS, add touch controls, follow Apple submission guidelines when ready.

## Action
- Saved this planning note for future reference.
